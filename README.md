## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The most important thing I got to know through this project is to manage states of a react component at multiple places. It was troublesome at start but got the hang of it.

### Useful resources

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me to understand and write down markdown.

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Free Resources for most of the programming languages with detailed examples.

- [react.dev](https://react.dev/) - official react documention to learn react.
